#PROJECT 2

TITLE: Obesity in 'x' region

We want to show the levels of obesity in some region on the world divided by gender and age.
We will locate the % of obesity in a map in which each % will be related with the size of the circles.
We will use MySQL for the database.

The purpose of the project is to show how obesity is distributed in different regions of a country and how it affects 
people and with that aware institutions to create healthcare programs.
